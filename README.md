akubra-glacier
==============

This is an [Akubra](http://github.com/akubra/akuba) blob store API implementation of top of Amazon Glacier, being built as part of the Fedora Futures project.

You need to have the jar built by this project, as well as the AWS SDK (and third-party dependencies) in your java classpath.

A Fedora akubra-llstore.xml spring file that uses glacier (for everything. not recommended) is available here:
